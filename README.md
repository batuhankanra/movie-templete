# Movie-Template 

## Description
This project focuses on the use of Axios and the search bar implementation. I believe that by developing this project further, the topics will increase significantly, but for now, it's like this.

# Features
- Movie Search: Users can search for movie titles and view the relevant results.
- Data Fetching with Axios: Movie data is fetched using The Movie Database (TMDb) API.(https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started)
- State Management with Redux: The application state is managed using Redux, making data management easier.
- Responsive Design: It features a modern and responsive interface created with TailwindCSS.
- Modal for Detailed View: When users click on a movie, a modal displays detailed information with a blurred background and a smaller poster in focus for a visually  appealing layout.

# Technologies
- React: Used to build user interface components.
- Redux Toolkit: For managing application state.
- Axios: HTTP client for fetching data from APIs.
- TailwindCSS: A CSS framework for modern and responsive design.
- Vite: A modern build tool for a fast development process.
